## Step 5: Explore Crome Mod Features
 
Once you have installed Crome 1.6.5, you can start exploring its features. Crome adds several new ores to the game, such as copper, tin, silver, lead, platinum, titanium, and chromium. These ores can be found in different biomes and depths, and they have different properties and uses.
 
You can use these ores to craft new tools, armor, and weapons with different stats and abilities. For example, you can craft a titanium sword that deals more damage than a diamond sword, or a chromium pickaxe that can mine faster than a netherite pickaxe. You can also craft a crome ingot by combining all the other ores, which can be used to make the ultimate crome tools, armor, and weapons.
 
Crome also enhances the mining experience by adding new features like ore veins and ore clusters. Ore veins are large groups of ores that spawn together, making them easier to find and mine. Ore clusters are small groups of ores that spawn on the surface of stone blocks, making them visible without breaking the blocks.
 
Crome also adds ore generation options that you can customize in the config file. You can change the spawn rate, size, height, and biome of each ore type. You can also enable or disable ore veins and ore clusters. This way, you can tailor your mining experience to your liking.
